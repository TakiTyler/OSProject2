-- ABOUT AI USAGE --

Yes I did use AI as a tool for this assignment. 
The way I used it was to provide a step-by-step guideline on how to tackle the project. 
In each step, it would ask me questions on how to solve the specific issue.
For example, it would ask me how to properly deal with acquiring and releasing locks.
I would give my response, for the previous example I said something along the lines of needing to acquire read / write locks BEFORE doing any read / write action & release locks AFTER the action.
When it would provide code, I'd do my own research online to see if the provided sections truly would work.
Additionally, I would run my code through to check for errors. This helped catch some memory management issues + edge cases with imports.
